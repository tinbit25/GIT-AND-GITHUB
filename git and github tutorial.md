## What is Git?

Git is a **version control system** that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. It helps developers:
- Keep track of changes.
- Collaborate on code without overwriting each other's work.
- Roll back to previous versions of their code.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Repository (repo)**: A directory that contains all project files and the history of changes made to those files.
- **Commit**: A snapshot of your repository at a particular point in time.
- **Branch**: A separate working version of your code, often used for experimenting or developing new features.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a **cloud-based platform** that helps developers store, manage, and collaborate on Git repositories. It adds a social layer to Git by allowing you to:
- Host your repositories online.
- Collaborate with others through pull requests and issues.
- Manage projects and track progress.

### Why Use GitHub?
- **Collaboration**: Teams can work together on projects from anywhere in the world.
- **Backup**: Your code is securely stored in the cloud.
- **Open Source**: Many open-source projects are hosted on GitHub, allowing you to contribute to or learn from other developers’ code.

## Getting Started with Git

### Installation

To start using Git, you need to install it on your system.

#### Windows:
Download and install Git from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/).

#### macOS:
Open the terminal and run:
```bash
brew install git
```

#### Linux:
Run the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

### Setting Up Git
Once installed, configure Git with your name and email (this information will be associated with your commits):
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### Basic Commands

| Command                   | Description                                               |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git init`                | Initialize a new Git repository                            |
| `git status`              | Check the status of your repository                        |
| `git add <file>`          | Stage a file for commit                                    |
| `git commit -m "message"` | Commit your changes with a message                         |
| `git log`                 | View commit history                                        |
| `git clone <repo-url>`    | Clone an existing repository                               |

## Creating a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in (or sign up if you don’t have an account).
2. Click the **"New Repository"** button.
3. Choose a name, description (optional), and set the repository to public or private.
4. Click **Create repository**.
5. After the repository is created, follow the instructions to push an existing Git repo or create a new one.

### Pushing to GitHub

Once your Git repository is set up locally, you can push it to GitHub:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Collaborating on GitHub

Collaboration in GitHub often involves **forking** repositories and making changes via **pull requests**.

### Steps for Collaborating:
1. **Fork** the repository you want to contribute to.
2. **Clone** your forked version:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
   ```
3. **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```
4. Make your changes and commit them.
5. **Push** your changes to your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```
6. Open a **pull request** from your forked repository to the original project.

## Git Branching and Merging

Branching allows you to develop features in isolation, and merging incorporates the changes into the main branch.

### Key Branching Commands

| Command                            | Description                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git branch`                       | List all branches                                        |
| `git branch <branch-name>`         | Create a new branch                                      |
| `git checkout <branch-name>`       | Switch to another branch                                 |
| `git merge <branch-name>`          | Merge a branch into the current branch                   |

To delete a branch after merging:
```bash
git branch -d branch-name
```

### Handling Merge Conflicts
If multiple people edit the same file, Git may produce a **merge conflict**. Here’s how to resolve it:
1. Open the conflicting file in your text editor.
2. Locate the conflict markers `<<<<<<`, `======`, and `>>>>>>`.
3. Choose which changes to keep and remove the conflict markers.
4. Stage the resolved file and commit.

## Best Practices

- **Commit Often**: Make small, meaningful commits frequently.
- **Write Clear Commit Messages**: Describe what changes were made and why.
- **Branching**: Use branches to keep your work organized. Keep the main branch stable.
- **Pull Requests**: Review code through pull requests for team collaboration.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. `Permission Denied (Publickey)`
   - This error occurs when Git can’t authenticate you. Make sure your SSH key is properly set up on GitHub.
   - Solution: Follow [GitHub's SSH guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

### 2. Merge Conflict
   - This happens when two people change the same lines of code.
   - Solution: Manually resolve the conflict in the file and commit the changes.

### 3. Detached HEAD State
   - Occurs when you checkout a commit instead of a branch.
   - Solution: Switch back to a branch with `git checkout branch-name`.
