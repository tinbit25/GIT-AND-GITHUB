1.     Clone the repository to your local machine:
      git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
      (Replace username with your GitHub username.)

      Create and track file.txt:
      echo "Your text here" > file.txt
      git add file.txt
      Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

      git commit -m "Add file.txt with initial content"
      See a summary of the changes made so far:

      git log --oneline --graph --decorate
      Push your changes to the remote GitHub repository:

      git push origin main
      Check the status after further changes to file.txt:

      git status
      Push the changes made in file.txt to GitHub:

      git add file.txt
      git commit -m "Update file.txt with new content"
      git push origin main
2.     1. Create the directory, file, and initialize a Git repository:
     
      mkdir LocalRepoProject
      cd LocalRepoProject
      echo "Hello, Git and GitHub!" > hello.txt
      git init -b main
      2. Add the tech.txt file to the staging area and commit it:
      
      git add tech.txt
      git commit -m "Add tech.txt with greeting"
      3. Create a new repository on GitHub named LocalRepoProject:
      Go to GitHub and create a new repository named LocalRepoProject.
      Do not initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license.
      4. Link the local repository to the GitHub repository and push changes:
     
      git remote add origin https://github.com/username/LocalRepoProject.git
      git push -u origin main
      (Replace username with your GitHub username.)

      3.    Clone a Repository:
      Clone the repository https://github.com/tinbit25/TobeForked to your local machine into a directory named TobeLocal.

      git clone https://github.com/tinbit25/TobeForked.git TobeLocal
      cd TobeLocal

      Make Changes and Commit:
      Inside TobeLocal, create a new file called notes.txt. Add the text "My updates to this repository" and save it. Stage this file and commit it with the message: "Add notes.txt file".

      echo "My updates to this repository" > notes.txt
      git add notes.txt
      git commit -m "Add notes.txt file"

      Fork and Link a Repository:
      Fork the repository https://github.com/tinbit25/TobeForked to your GitHub account.
      Update the remote of your local repository to point to your fork:

      git remote set-url origin https://github.com/your-username/TobeForked.git
      git push -u origin main
      (Replace your-username with your GitHub username.)

      Push Further Changes:
      Make additional changes to notes.txt (e.g., add more text), stage them, commit them, and push them to your fork:

      echo "Additional updates to the repository" >> notes.txt
      git add notes.txt
      git commit -m "Update notes.txt with additional content"
      git push
